# SSAPy Toolkit

**SSAPy Toolkit** (Python package: `ssapy_toolkit`, sometimes abbreviated
*SSATK*) is a collection of higher-level, analysis-ready extensions for the
[SSAPy](https://github.com/llnl/SSAPy) orbital-modeling ecosystem. Where SSAPy
provides the core high-fidelity propagation and modeling engine, the Toolkit
adds astrodynamics utilities, orbital-transfer design, coordinate/time
conversions, brightness and observables modeling, launch and propulsion
helpers, orbit and 6-DoF propagators, rich plotting, and data I/O to support day-to-day research and
engineering workflows.

SSAPy itself is a fast, flexible, high-fidelity orbital modeling and analysis
tool for orbits spanning from low-Earth orbit into the cislunar regime, with
configurable force models (Earth and lunar gravity, radiation pressure, drag,
planetary perturbations, maneuvers), multiple propagators, orbit determination,
Monte Carlo / uncertainty-quantification workflows, and ground/space observer
models. See the SSAPy repository for full details:
<https://github.com/llnl/SSAPy>.

## Why SSATK?

SSATK is the analyst-facing layer around SSAPy: it keeps common orbital
mechanics, plotting, transfer-design, data I/O, and early 6-DoF spacecraft
workflows in one import path while preserving SSAPy as the core propagation
engine. The benchmarking review compares SSATK against adjacent astrodynamics,
mission-design, and 6-DoF tools:
[`docs/benchmarking_ssatk.rst`](docs/benchmarking_ssatk.rst). The 6-DoF design
study explains why SSATK is adding a lightweight spacecraft body/component
layer instead of trying to replace established tools such as Basilisk, Tudat,
GMAT, Orekit, STK, or FreeFlyer:
[`docs/design/6dof_architecture.rst`](docs/design/6dof_architecture.rst).

## Features

- **Orbital mechanics & astrodynamics** — Keplerian utilities, ellipse fitting,
  r/v conversions, Lagrange points, and synthetic orbit populations.
- **Orbital transfers** — a full transfer-design suite: Hohmann, coplanar,
  Lambert, inclination-change, and rendezvous transfers; continuous-thrust
  transfers; shooter and optimal-transfer methods; and burn-to-delta-v
  conversions with finite-burn modeling.
- **Coordinate transforms & time conversions** — GCRF-to-ITRF, GCRF-to-NTW,
  GCRF-to-LLH/lon-lat, GCRF-to-lunar, J2000-to-GCRF, Cartesian/spherical/
  cylindrical, equatorial/ecliptic, sky-angle helpers, and satellite operation
  frames (NTW, RTN, LVLH, VNB, body, topocentric, and line-of-sight), using a
  right-handed NTW (N = T x W) convention consistent with SSAPy.
- **Observables & brightness modeling** — Lambertian magnitude / brightness,
  including object thermal emission, Earth-shadow effects, and ground
  reflectance.
- **Plotting & visualization** — orbit, ground-track, cislunar (2-D and 3-D),
  and transfer plots; interactive dashboards; and animated GIF/video output.
- **Propagators** — adaptive DOP853 translational propagation, fixed-step RK4/leapfrog helpers, and 6-DoF propagation.
- **6-DoF dynamics** — coupled translational and rigid-body attitude
  propagation with quaternion attitude states, optional user acceleration and
  torque models, gravity-gradient torque, fixed-facet drag/SRP, thrusters,
  articulated facet transforms, magnetic torquers, reaction wheels, dynamic
  tank mass properties, dry-mass stopping events, and a basic quaternion PD
  controller.
- **Launch & propulsion** — launch-pad definitions, gravity-turn ascent,
  engine catalogs, thrust profiles, and fuel/burn utilities.
- **Data I/O** — HDF5 helpers (including dictionary/HDF5 conversion with array
  handling and selective key loading), plus CSV, JSON, XML, and pickle I/O, and
  TLE/3LE parsing.
- **SSAPy wrappers & HPC helpers** — convenience wrappers around SSAPy orbits,
  propagators, and satellite keyword arguments, plus utilities for HPC
  workflows.
- **Demo gallery** — a runnable gallery of worked examples with inline output.

## Installation

SSAPy Toolkit is a standard Python package.

```
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

This installs the package in editable mode along with development dependencies
(testing, linting, docs tools, JavaScript validation helpers, etc.). Runtime
plotting dependencies include Plotly, Matplotlib, Pillow, Kaleido, imageio, and
SSAPy-Data assets. Node.js 20+ is used only to validate the self-contained
JavaScript viewer sources; GitHub Actions installs it with `actions/setup-node`,
and local developers can use system Node.js or `nodeenv`.

SSAPy Toolkit builds on SSAPy; see the
[SSAPy](https://github.com/llnl/SSAPy) repository for its installation details.

## Usage

The Toolkit is intended to be the main user-facing entry point. Shared SSAPy
constants are available through the Toolkit, so users do not need to know
whether a constant originates in base SSAPy or Toolkit-specific helpers:

```
import ssapy_toolkit as ssatk

print(ssatk.EARTH_MU)
print(ssatk.constants.RGEO)

orbit = ssatk.Orbit.fromKeplerianElements(
    a=ssatk.constants.RGEO,
    e=0.0,
    i=0.0,
    pa=0.0,
    raan=0.0,
    trueAnomaly=0.0,
    t=0.0,
)
r, v = ssatk.rv(orbit, time=[0.0, 60.0])
```

Base SSAPy core objects such as `Orbit`, `rv`, `groundTrack`, and `AccelKepler`
are lazily available through `ssapy_toolkit`. Toolkit duplicate helpers take
precedence at the top level, so names such as `ssapy_toolkit.norm`,
`ssapy_toolkit.deg0to360`, and `ssapy_toolkit.period` resolve to Toolkit
implementations. Toolkit submodules also win on collisions such as
`ssapy_toolkit.io` and `ssapy_toolkit.utils`; the base package remains available
as `ssapy_toolkit.ssapy` when direct SSAPy module access is needed.

For workflow functions, import the specific Toolkit module you need:

```
from ssapy_toolkit.orbital_mechanics import keplerian
from ssapy_toolkit.orbital_mechanics import transfer_hohmann
from ssapy_toolkit.orbital_mechanics import transfer_bielliptic
from ssapy_toolkit.coordinates import gcrf_to_itrf
from ssapy_toolkit.plots import orbit_plot
```

For high-accuracy translational propagation, use the adaptive DOP853 wrapper in
`propagators_orbit` instead of the older fixed-step helpers:

```
import numpy as np
from ssapy_toolkit.constants import EARTH_MU
from ssapy_toolkit.propagators_orbit import propagate_orbit_state

radius = 7_000_000.0
speed = np.sqrt(EARTH_MU / radius)
traj = propagate_orbit_state(
    r0=[radius, 0.0, 0.0],
    v0=[0.0, speed, 0.0],
    times=np.linspace(0.0, 3600.0, 121),
)
```

For rigid-body spacecraft dynamics, use `Spacecraft` when you want an
`Orbit`-like object with attitude, angular rate, inertia, and mass attached.
Use `Spacecraft.from_orbit(orbit, ...)` to attach 6-DoF state to an SSAPy
`Orbit`, `spacecraft.to_orbit()` to return the translational state to SSAPy,
and `propagate_6dof` directly for lower-level numerical propagation.

```
import numpy as np
import ssapy_toolkit as ssatk
from ssapy_toolkit.accelerations_6dof import SpacecraftAccelJ2, constant_body_thrust
from ssapy_toolkit.plots import orbit_plot

sat = ssatk.Spacecraft(
    r=[7_000_000.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    v=[0.0, 7_500.0, 0.0],
    q=[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],       # [w, x, y, z], body to inertial
    omega=[0.0, 0.0, 0.001],      # body-frame rad/s
    inertia=np.diag([10.0, 12.0, 8.0]),
    mass=100.0,
)

traj = sat.propagate(
    times=np.linspace(0.0, 600.0, 61),
    acceleration=SpacecraftAccelJ2(),
    body_acceleration=constant_body_thrust([0.0, 0.01, 0.0], sat.mass),
    gravity_gradient=True,
)

orbit_plot(traj.r, traj.t, view="3d")
```

Reusable 6-DoF acceleration models live in ``ssapy_toolkit.accelerations_6dof`` and
include SSAPy-like classes for Kepler gravity, J2, third-body gravity,
cannonball drag, cannonball solar radiation pressure, constant inertial/NTW/body
accelerations, summed acceleration/torque models, and attitude-dependent
flat-plate drag/SRP models, facet drag/SRP models, thruster torque, and
magnetic-dipole and gravity-gradient torque. Reaction wheels and
``SpacecraftAttitudePD`` provide a small actuator/control layer for attitude
studies; reaction-wheel momentum is propagated as an optional state when the
body defines wheels, and configured ``momentum_capacity`` values prevent
commands from driving wheels beyond their stored angular-momentum limits.
``SpaceEnvironment`` supplies epoch-aware Sun/Moon ephemerides, atmosphere
density and velocity, magnetic field, and disk-overlap Earth/Moon eclipse
fractions for environment-backed force models. Use ``third_bodies=True`` for
Moon/Sun perturbations, ``third_bodies="planets"`` for Mercury through Neptune
except Earth, or ``third_bodies="all"`` for a full Solar-System perturbation
set. Optional gravity-gradient torque supports central Earth or Earth/Moon/Sun
models. Common force-stack presets are available through
``SpaceEnvironment.force_models(preset="leo"|"earth_orbit"|"cislunar"|"all")``
and individual options can still override each preset. The default atmosphere
velocity is rigid Earth co-rotation; pass ``atmosphere_velocity_model=...`` for
wind or corotation overrides. The default magnetic field is a dependency-light
centered Earth dipole; use ``magnetic_field_model="igrf"`` for optional
``ppigrf``-backed IGRF field synthesis or pass a callable for mission-specific
models.
Thrusters report positive propellant mass flow from thrust and specific impulse;
``propagate_6dof`` can propagate mass when a mass-flow model is supplied.
For bodies with tanks, propagated mass updates tank propellant proportionally so
center of mass and inertia evolve during finite burns. Use
`propellant_empty_event` or `mass_floor_event` to stop burns at dry mass.

Finite maneuver accelerations use ``SpacecraftManeuverAccel``. Use
``frame="rtn"``/``"lvlh"``/``"ric"`` for common radial-transverse-normal
operations, ``frame="vnb"`` for velocity-normal-binormal commands,
``frame="body"`` for body-mounted thrust, or ``frame="ntw"`` for exact SSAPy
``[N, T, W]`` convention. Thrust can be constant, trapezoidal, smoothstep,
exponential, pulsed, callable, or loaded from CSV with ``ThrustCurve``; citable
engine data belongs in SSAPy-Data rather than this source repository and can be
loaded with ``load_thrust_curve_data(...)`` once packaged.

Preset spacecraft bodies live in `ssapy_toolkit.satellites`. Use
`satellite_design(...)` to start from a common bus, override dimensions or
mass, then add components, tanks, facets, or thrusters as needed:

```
from ssapy_toolkit.accelerations_6dof import (
    SpacecraftFacetDrag,
    SpacecraftFacetSolRad,
    SpacecraftManeuverAccel,
    SpacecraftThrusterAccel,
)

body = ssatk.satellite_design(
    "earth_observation",
    mass=500.0,
    solar_array_area=10.0,
).with_thrusters(
    ssatk.Thruster(thrust=0.2, direction_body=[1, 0, 0], position_body=[0, 0.5, 0]),
).with_components(
    ssatk.Component(mass=25.0, position_body=[0.0, 0.0, 0.7], name="payload"),
).with_magnetic_dipoles(
    ssatk.MagneticDipole(moment_body=[0.2, 0.0, 0.0], name="x_magnetorquer"),
).with_reaction_wheels(
    *ssatk.reaction_wheel_triplet(max_torque=0.02),
)

sat = ssatk.Spacecraft(r=[7e6, 0, 0], v=[0, 7500, 0], body=body)
q_target = ssatk.attitude_quaternion_from_frame("nadir_velocity", r=sat.r, v=sat.v)
burn = SpacecraftManeuverAccel(
    ssatk.thrust_profile_trapezoid(0.2, start=120.0, burn_time=60.0, rise_time=5.0),
    frame="rtn",
    direction=[0, 1, 0],
    isp=220.0,
)
traj = sat.propagate(
    times=np.linspace(0.0, 600.0, 61),
    models=[
        SpacecraftFacetDrag(density=1e-12),
        SpacecraftFacetSolRad([ssatk.AU, 0, 0]),
        burn,
        ssatk.SpacecraftMagneticTorque([0, 2e-5, 0]),
        ssatk.SpacecraftReactionWheelTorque([0, 0, 0.01]),
        ssatk.SpacecraftAttitudePD(q_target=q_target, kp=0.05, kd=0.2, max_torque=0.02),
        SpacecraftThrusterAccel(),
    ],
)
```

`transfer_bielliptic` computes the analytic three-impulse, two-half-ellipse
transfer between coplanar circular orbits through an intermediate apoapsis
radius. It is useful for quick radius-to-radius trade studies; use
`transfer_ssapy` or `transfer_optimal` when fixed epochs, target phasing,
perturbed propagation, or non-circular boundary states matter.
Transfer entry points accept either SSAPy `Orbit` objects (`orbit1`/`orbit2`,
`initial`/`target`) or raw inertial state vectors (`r1, v1, r2, v2`). For
`transfer_optimal`, set `departure_mode="now"` or `leave_now=True` to depart
from the supplied state; leave the default `departure_mode="optimize"` to search
for the best departure phase/time.
Set `stage_mode="immediate"` or `stage_mode="timed"` to explicitly search
staged transfers through candidate staging orbits; `stage_mode="best"` compares
the direct and staged routes. Timed staging allows each post-stage leg to wait
for an appropriate phase instead of leaving the staging orbit immediately. The
default `n_stage_stops=1` searches one intermediate staging orbit; increase
`n_stage_stops` and set `stage_beam_width` for bounded multi-stop searches.
For larger design trades, `transfer_optimal` also accepts a structured
`problem={...}` schema that groups boundary conditions, objective, constraints,
route, and solver controls in one call:

```
from ssapy_toolkit.orbital_mechanics import transfer_optimal

result = transfer_optimal(
    problem={
        "boundary": {
            "initial": orbit1,              # or r1/v1/r2/v2 at top level
            "target": orbit2,
            "departure_mode": "leave now", # or "leave whenever"
            # inject: free-phase/first burn only; intercept: target position only;
            # rendezvous: target position + velocity; insertion: free-phase velocity match
            "arrival_mode": "rendezvous",
        },
        "objective": {"minimize": "delta_v", "delta_v_mode": "total"},
        "constraints": {
            "tof_range": (1800.0, 86400.0),
            "dv_budget": None,
            "perigee_altitude_min": 100e3,
            "max_burns": 4,
        },
        "route": {
            "mode": "multi_stage",         # direct, immediate, multi_stage, best
            "timing": "optimized",         # immediate or optimized/timed
            "n_stage_stops": 1,
            "stage_candidates": {"radii": [20_000e3, 40_000e3]},
        },
        "solver": {"n_grid": (8, 8), "polish": False, "refine": False},
    },
)
```

The result diagnostics include `problem_schema="ssatk.transfer_problem.v1"`
when the structured interface is used.

`orbit_plot` is the main entry point for in-space trajectory plots. It uses a
four-panel orbit view by default, and also accepts compact selectors for common
slices and cislunar views:

```
orbit_plot(r, t, frame="gcrf")                         # xy, xz, yz, and 3-D
orbit_plot(r, t, view="xy", frame="itrf")             # one 2-D slice
orbit_plot(r, t, view=("xy", "xz", "3d"))            # custom panels
orbit_plot(r, t, view="lunar_yz")                     # lunar-fixed YZ slice
orbit_plot(r, t, view="lunar_xy", coordinate="gcrf")  # override coordinates
orbit_plot(r, t, view="ground track")                 # wide ground-track map
orbit_plot(r, t, view=("groundtrack", "globe"))       # map + 3-D globe
orbit_plot(r, t, view="dashboard")                    # map, globe, and slices
orbit_plot(r, t, view="cislunar_3d")                  # lunar-fixed 3-D view
orbit_plot(r, t, view="cislunar_xy")                  # GCRF + lunar XY views
orbit_plot(r, t, view="cislunar_dashboard")           # cislunar dashboard
orbit_plot(r, t, view="xy", save="quicklooks/orbit.mp4")  # animated MP4
orbit_plot(r, t, view="xy", save="quicklooks/orbit.gif")  # animated GIF
```

All plotting helpers accept `save`, `savefig`, `save_fig`, `save_figure`,
`savepath`, and `save_path` as equivalent save-path keywords. Relative names
are saved under `~/ssatk_output/figures`; absolute paths are used exactly as
provided. Set `SSATK_OUTPUT_DIR` to choose a different output root explicitly.
Use `ssatk_path` and `ssatk_fig` for direct path and figure-save helpers.

For general data products, `ssatk_save` and `ssatk_read` choose the storage
format from the file extension. Bare and relative data filenames are rooted
under `~/ssatk_output`; bare and relative figure filenames are rooted under
`~/ssatk_output/figures`; absolute paths are honored.

```
ssatk.ssatk_save({"r": r, "v": v, "t": t}, "runs/orbit.h5")
state = ssatk.ssatk_read("runs/orbit.h5")

ssatk.ssatk_save(r, "arrays/state.npy")
ssatk.ssatk_save({"r": r, "v": v}, "arrays/state.npz")
ssatk.ssatk_save(table, "tables/summary.csv")
ssatk.ssatk_save(fig, "quicklooks/orbit.png")
```

For keyed HDF5 or NPZ outputs, pass `key=`. Non-mapping objects default to
`"data"`; dictionaries use their own keys; nested dictionaries become nested
HDF5 groups or slash-delimited NPZ members.

More detailed examples can be found in the categorized `demos/` directory. The
demo gallery runner searches those subfolders recursively. To render the full
demo gallery as a visualization document:

```
ssapy-demo-gallery
```

The command can be run from any directory after installation. It writes the
HTML report to `~/ssatk_output/documents/index.html` by default and prints
the exact output path when it finishes. Use `--open` to open the report in a
browser, `--output PATH` to choose a different output directory, or
`--demos-dir PATH` to run demos from a source checkout explicitly. The default
does not fall back to the clone directory; set `SSATK_OUTPUT_DIR` if you want
a non-home output root.

---

## Development

To run the test suite:

```
pytest tests
```

The current CI lint gate checks fatal Ruff errors in changed Python files; it is
not a full formatting or style pass:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
base_ref="$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)"
mapfile -t python_files < <(
  git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMR "$base_ref" HEAD -- '*.py'
)
if ((${#python_files[@]})); then
  ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F82 "${python_files[@]}"
fi
```

Optional local repo mapping with Graphify:

```
pipx install graphifyy  # or: python -m pip install graphifyy
bash scripts/install_graphify_hook.sh
```

The installer writes a local `.git/hooks/post-commit` hook. After each commit,
the hook runs `graphify . --update --wiki` in the background when the
`graphify` CLI is available and writes ignored output under `graphify-out/`.
Disable it for one commit with `SSATK_GRAPHIFY_HOOK=0 git commit ...`, or force
foreground execution with `SSATK_GRAPHIFY_FOREGROUND=1 git commit ...`.

---

## Documentation

Project documentation is built with Sphinx and hosted on Read the Docs.
Once configured, the latest documentation will be available at:

<https://ssapy-toolkit.readthedocs.io>

To build the docs locally (after installing dev dependencies):

```
cd docs
make html
```

The built HTML files will be in `docs/_build/html/`.
