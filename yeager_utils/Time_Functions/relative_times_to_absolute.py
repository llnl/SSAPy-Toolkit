def time_rel_to_abs(times, ref, anchor='start'):
    """
    Convert relative times (seconds) into absolute astropy Time stamps.

    Parameters
    ----------
    times : array-like of float
        Sequence of time stamps in seconds. These are treated as relative
        offsets along a time series (not necessarily starting at 0).
    ref : astropy.time.Time or str or float/int (optional)
        The reference timestamp to anchor the series.
        - If Time: used directly.
        - If str: parsed by astropy as UTC, e.g. "2025-01-01 00:00:00".
        - If float/int: interpreted as GPS seconds.
    anchor : {'start', 'end'}, default 'start'
        Which sample the reference corresponds to:
        - 'start': ref is the absolute time of times[0]
        - 'end'  : ref is the absolute time of times[-1]

    Returns
    -------
    astropy.time.Time
        Vector Time object of the same length as `times`, with absolute stamps.

    Notes
    -----
    - This mirrors the behavior of a typical get_times helper: evenly applies
      offsets in seconds to a reference Time.
    - The relative sequence does not need to start at 0. Offsets are computed
      against the chosen anchor sample.
