    """Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time in radians (IAU 1982 series).

    Sidereal time is measured against the stars rather than the Sun, so a
    sidereal day is ~23h56m04s -- about four minutes short of a solar day,
    because Earth must turn slightly more than 360 degrees to bring the Sun
    back overhead.

    This is the rotation angle between an inertial frame (where star
    catalogues live) and an Earth-fixed one, so it is what any GCRF-to-ECEF
    conversion needs: star fields, ground tracks, and the subsolar point all
    depend on it.

    The cubic series is good to well under an arcsecond for any epoch this
    toolkit handles; verified against astropy to 0.01 s of sidereal time in
    tests/test_magfield_physics.py.

    Previously defined in ssapy_toolkit/plots/starfield.py -- see julian_date
    for why it moved.
