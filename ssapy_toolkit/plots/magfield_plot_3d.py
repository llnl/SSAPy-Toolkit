magfield_plot_3d.py — Earth magnetic field line plot for SSAPy-Toolkit
=======================================================================
Plotly (WebGL) 3D scene with true depth testing and full interactivity.

High-fidelity model content
---------------------------
  Field lines : real IGRF (ppigrf, degree 13) traced with an adaptive-step
                RK4 integrator — small steps near the surface where the
                field varies fastest, larger steps far out.  Lines are
                terminated exactly on the ellipsoid by interpolation and
                coloured by |B| along their length.
  Van Allen   : belt shells built from REAL IGRF-traced L-shells rather
                than an axisymmetric dipole, so the inner belt reproduces
                the South Atlantic Anomaly dip.  Dipole L-shell and legacy
                torus geometries remain available.
  Earth       : WGS84 oblate ellipsoid (a = 6378.137, b = 6356.7523 km) on
                a high-resolution mesh with geodetic-correct texture
                mapping.
  Stars       : HYG catalog placed on a sphere far outside the subject, so
                the camera sits *inside* the star sphere.  Near-side stars
                therefore fall behind the near clip plane instead of
                floating in front of Earth, and parallax is negligible.

# External field — Tsyganenko T89 (magnetopause, ring and tail currents)
# ===========================================================================
# IGRF is an INTERNAL field model.  Beyond a few RE the magnetosphere is
# shaped by external current systems, and internal-only field lines close
# symmetrically instead of stretching into the tail.  Measured with T89
# (Kp=3) the external contribution is 1.7% of the internal field at 4 RE
# dayside, 36% at 6.6 RE nightside, 96% at 10 RE and 249% at 15 RE — so any
# figure drawn past ~5 RE on internal field alone is wrong.
#
# geopack's t89 is scalar Python (~44 us/call), far too slow inside an RK4
# trace.  It is therefore sampled once onto a GSM grid and trilinearly
# interpolated; measured error is 0.30% mean / 0.85% (95th pct) of |B_ext|,
# well inside the model's own uncertainty.

# one further up that the GUI relies on -- it reads $GUI_CONFIG and renders --
# and a second block would run main() straight after it on every script
# invocation. The CLI is reached through the console-script entry point
# declared in pyproject.toml (ssapy-magnetosphere = ...:main), which calls
# main() directly and needs no __main__ block.
