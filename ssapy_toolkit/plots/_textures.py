"""Locate the equirectangular Earth texture used by the 2-D maps and globes.

Historically every plot asked SSAPy for ``earth.png`` (5400 x 2700 Blue
Marble, longitude -180..180 left to right, north up). That file lived in
SSAPy's Git LFS tree and in the retired ``llnl-ssapy-data`` archive, but none
of the split ``ssatk-data-*`` 0.0.1 wheels ships it. ``ssatk-data-core`` does
ship ``earth_day_2048.jpg`` (2048 x 1024) in the same projection and
orientation (normalized cross-correlation 0.866 at zero longitude shift
against ``earth.png``, peak at zero shift, no vertical flip), so it is the
fallback here.
