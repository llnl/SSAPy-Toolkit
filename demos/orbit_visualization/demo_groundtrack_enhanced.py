Demo script for ssapy_toolkit groundtrack_enhanced.

This is the instrumented ground track: unlike the plain groundtrack_plot demo,
which draws tracks and nothing else, this one answers an operational question --
*when can a specific site actually see this satellite?*

It adds, on top of the track:

  * a ground site at a real latitude/longitude, with its visibility circle
    computed for a minimum elevation angle (10 deg here, the usual mask for
    horizon clutter and atmospheric refraction);
  * eclipse shading along the track, from real Sun geometry, so you can see
    which passes are in sunlight and which are in Earth's shadow;
  * the subsolar point and day/night terminator at the epoch;
  * a returned site_visibility_pct, the fraction of the propagated arc the
    site can see -- a number, not just a picture.

Change site_lat/site_lon to move the ground station, or swap in your own
ephemeris. To drive it from live TLEs instead of the synthetic orbit below,
see ssapy_toolkit/plots/tle_updater.py; that path needs Space-Track
credentials and network access, so this demo stays self-contained.

Pytest-safe mode:
- shorter propagation and fewer points
- does not save figures by default
