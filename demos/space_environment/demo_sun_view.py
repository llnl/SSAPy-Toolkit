    # aspectmode="data" is required here -- without it, Plotly scales each
    # of the x/y/z axes independently to fill the plot area, which turns
    # every sphere in the scene into a squashed ellipsoid (confirmed by an
    # actual rendered screenshot showing exactly this). "data" keeps the
    # axes proportional to their real data ranges instead.
    #
    # A dark background is also needed here, not just cosmetic -- Plotly's
    # default background is white, which would make white/pale star
    # markers essentially invisible.
    #
    # Axis range vs. camera zoom -- these need to be handled separately:
    #
    # An earlier version set the axis range tight around the near-field
    # objects (Sun/Moon), on the assumption that Plotly's 3D traces aren't
    # clipped to the axis range and only use it for camera framing. An
    # actual rendered screenshot proved that assumption WRONG: stars sitting
    # beyond that range were visibly cut off at a hard boundary. So the
    # axis range here is instead set generously large -- safely containing
    # the entire starfield -- so nothing gets clipped.
    #
    # Separately, camera.eye is set explicitly to start the view zoomed in
    # tight on the Sun/Earth scale, regardless of how large the full
    # (clipping-safe) axis range is. Plotly's default eye magnitude
    # (~1.25 per axis) frames the *entire* axis range; scaling that down
    # by (desired near-field view radius / actual axis range radius) gives
    # a tight initial zoom while the full starfield remains reachable by
    # zooming out manually (it's inside the range, just not what the
    # camera starts framed to).
    axis_radius_km = sky_radius * 1.1   # generous margin beyond the stars themselves
    # 2.2x (rather than a tighter 1.5x) gives both the Sun and Earth
    # comfortable room in the initial frame -- Earth sits at the scene's
    # coordinate origin, so a tighter zoom calibrated only off the Sun's
    # distance ends up unintentionally very close to Earth too (they'd
    # share the same "near zoom" distance), making Earth look oversized
    # relative to the Sun (confirmed by an actual screenshot showing
    # exactly this).
