Demo script for ssapy_toolkit coverage_analysis.

Answers the question a ground station actually asks. Not "is this satellite
overhead" -- "how often can I see it, for how long, and what is the worst gap
between contacts?" Two figures:

  site_analysis_<sat>.png
      One propagation window seen from one site: elevation and azimuth against
      time, the satellite's own illumination state, and which windows are
      genuinely observable. That last panel is the logical AND of three
      conditions -- satellite above the elevation mask, satellite sunlit, site
      in darkness -- rather than a single collapsed percentage, because a pass
      that fails any one of them is not a pass you can use optically.

  coverage_metrics_<sat>.png
      The pass structure behind a coverage percentage, computed at every point
      on Earth: mean pass duration, longest gap between contacts, contacts per
      day, and total contact minutes per day. "% of time visible" cannot tell
      one clean usable pass from a dozen useless slivers at the same duty
      cycle; these four can. All are masked to zero outside the orbit's real
      inclination band rather than filled with a misleading low value.

HST is the example because its 28.5 degree inclination puts a hard edge on the
coverage map at roughly +/-50 degrees latitude -- visible proof the masking is
real geometry and not a colour-scale artefact. The site is Cape Canaveral,
which sits inside that band.

Runs offline. The TLE comes from the satellite list bundled with the toolkit,
so no Space-Track credentials and no network are needed. For current elements,
refresh explicitly with ssapy_toolkit.io.tle_updater.

Pytest-safe mode:
- coarse coverage grid, so the 3-day propagation stays quick
- does not save figures by default
